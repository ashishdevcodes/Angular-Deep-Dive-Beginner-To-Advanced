# Issue: `command not found: compdef` Warning in Terminal

## Problem
The warning `command not found: compdef` appeared every time a new terminal was opened. This occurred because the Angular CLI autocompletion script was added directly to `.zprofile` without ensuring Zsh's autocompletion system (`compinit`) was properly initialized.

## Steps Taken to Resolve

1. **Verified Zsh Completion System**:
   - Ensured that the Zsh autocompletion system was enabled by adding the following line to the `.zshrc` file:
     ```bash
     autoload -U compinit && compinit
     ```

2. **Updated `.zshrc` File**:
   - Ensured that the Angular CLI autocompletion script was sourced only in `.zshrc` with the following:
     ```bash
     if command -v ng &> /dev/null; then
       source <(ng completion script)
     fi
     ```

3. **Cleaned Up `.zprofile`**:
   - Removed all lines related to Angular CLI autocompletion from `.zprofile` to prevent redundant and conflicting sourcing:
     ```bash
     # Removed lines:
     #compdef ng
     ###--begin-ng-completions--###
     ...
     ###--end-ng-completions--###
     ```

4. **Reloaded `.zshrc`**:
   - Reloaded the `.zshrc` file to apply changes:
     ```bash
     source ~/.zshrc
     ```

5. **Tested Changes**:
   - Opened a new terminal and verified that the warning no longer appeared.
   - Confirmed Angular CLI autocompletion worked by typing `ng` and pressing `TAB`.

## Result
The issue was resolved successfully. The warning no longer appears, and Angular CLI autocompletion works as expected.
