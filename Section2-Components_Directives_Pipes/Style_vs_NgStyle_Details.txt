# Difference Between [style] and [ngStyle] in Angular

## Overview
Both `[style]` and `[ngStyle]` are used to apply inline styles dynamically in Angular, but they serve different purposes.

## [style] Directive

- **Purpose:** Binds a single CSS property dynamically.
- **Use Case:** Ideal for changing one style property based on some condition or dynamic value.
- **Example:**
  ```html
  <p [style.color]="isActive ? 'green' : 'red'">
    This text will be green if `isActive` is true, otherwise red.
  </p>
  ```

## [ngStyle] Directive

- **Purpose:** Applies multiple styles at once as an object.
- **Use Case:** Best for dynamically setting multiple style properties.
- **Example:**
  ```html
  <p [ngStyle]="{
    'color': isActive ? 'green' : 'red',
    'font-weight': isBold ? 'bold' : 'normal'
  }">
    This text will have dynamic color and font weight.
  </p>
  ```

## When to Use Which

| Feature       | `[style]`                           | `[ngStyle]`                       |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Use Case      | Single property binding             | Multiple style bindings           |
| Syntax        | `[style.property]="value"`          | `[ngStyle]="{ 'property': value }"` |
| Readability   | More readable for single properties | Better for multiple properties    |
| Performance   | Better for single property          | Involves processing an object     |

## Best Practices

1. **Minimize Inline Styling**: Prefer CSS classes for static styles to keep templates cleaner.
2. **Avoid Complex Logic in Templates**: Process complex styling logic in the component class and bind to a simple property.
3. **Use Descriptive Names**: Keep object keys in `[ngStyle]` clear and descriptive for readability.

## Conclusion

- Use `[style]` for single style property changes for simplicity and performance.
- Use `[ngStyle]` for dynamic styling involving multiple properties for flexibility and ease of use.
