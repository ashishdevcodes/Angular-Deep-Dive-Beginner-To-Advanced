### Steps Followed for Angular CLI Installation and Environment Path Setup

1. **Verified Node.js and npm Installation**:
   - Checked that Node.js (v18.x.x) and npm were installed using:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

2. **Installed Angular CLI Globally**:
   - Used the command to install Angular CLI globally:
     ```bash
     npm install -g @angular/cli
     ```

3. **Verified Angular CLI Installation**:
   - Confirmed the Angular CLI was installed using:
     ```bash
     ng version
     ```
     This displayed the Angular CLI version and other details.

4. **Configured Global npm Modules Path in `$PATH`**:
   - Determined the global npm modules path using:
     ```bash
     npm config get prefix
     ```
   - Added the path to the shell configuration file (`~/.zshrc` in this case):
     ```bash
     export PATH=$PATH:$(npm config get prefix)/bin
     ```
   - Reloaded the shell configuration file:
     ```bash
     source ~/.zshrc
     ```

5. **Tested `ng` Command**:
   - Verified Angular CLI commands worked by running:
     ```bash
     ng help
     ```
     This displayed a list of available Angular CLI commands.

### Notes:
- Running `ng` without arguments did not display help, but this behavior is acceptable as `ng help` works fine.
